A Code Example using C#

This Code Example is a sprite game I had written to explore the XBOX extension in VS2013 (the IDE I have available to me on my desktop). 

You can view the .cs code by opening any page called "TeddyAttack-ClassName", which will show my current proficiency in C# specifically.

I've included the solution, however it is not compatible with any VS version higher that VS2013 and requires the XBOX Game extension to run.

If you have any questions, please reach out to me.
